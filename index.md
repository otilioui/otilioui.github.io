## Bio
My work has always been at the intersection of environmental science and 
policy. I have focused on climate related issues since my masters and 
currently specialise in sea-level rise and the Law of the Sea with my 
Ph.D. My undergraduate degree was a BSc in Geography from University 
College London. Here my studies focused on small scale fisheries, 
environmental law and politics/policy. I was previously working as a 
research associate with UCSD's Superfund Research Center, focusing on 
systems thinking, climate, urban planning and public health issues.
